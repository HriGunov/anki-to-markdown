## Project: Anki Markdown Sync

This projects aims to solve the problem of using a markdown based system for Knowledge Management, and Anki at the same time. The current approach is to use a markdown file as the source of truth, and to use Anki as only as a tool for spaced repetition.

The main problem is that during normal Anki usage you will want to make corrections, adding tags or making other changes. This will lead to a divergence between the markdown file and the Anki database. This project aims to solve this problem by providing a way to sync the markdown file with the Anki database.

## Requirements

Running Anki with the AnkiConnect plugin installed. The plugin can be found [here](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159).
