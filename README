## Project: Anki Markdown Sync

This projects aims to solve the problem of using a markdown based system for Knowledge Management, and Anki at the same time. The current approach is to use a markdown file as the source of truth, and to use Anki as only as a tool for spaced repetition.

During normal Anki usage you will want to make corrections, like adding tags or making updating fields. This will lead to a divergence between the markdown file and the Anki database. When syncing the changes made in Anki will be lost, as the sync operation is one way (from markdown to Anki).

This project aims to solve this problem by providing a way to sync the markdown file with the Anki database.

## Requirements

Running Anki with the AnkiConnect plugin installed. The plugin can be found [here](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159).
